# End Ship Elytra Nuker
A not so destructive single-Mixin mod to allow replacing the end ship item... that's it

The config is located at `config/endship-elytra-nuker.json`:
```json
{
  "identifier": ""
}
```

Replace the `""` to an item identifier to use that item.
Example:
```json
{
  "identifier": "minecraft:diamond_block"
}
```

If left empty (`""`), the mod will remove the item and the item frame inside of the ship.
